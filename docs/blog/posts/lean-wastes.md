# The Seven Wastes of Lean Engineering

In manufacturing, Lean Thinking revolutionised how teams build products by relentlessly focusing on eliminating waste - anything that doesn’t add value for the customer.

This philosophy, born from the Toyota Production System, identifies seven types of waste (_“Muda”_ in Japanese). While these ideas started on factory floors, they’ve found a powerful second life in the world of software engineering.

Let’s explore how each of the seven wastes - plus a crucial eighth - shows up in modern software development, and how to spot (and stop) them in your team.

## 1. Transportation

In manufacturing, transportation waste is about unnecessary movement of materials.
In software, it’s about unnecessary movement of work - between teams, tools, or processes.

Every handoff creates delay and risk: waiting for QA to pick up a ticket, tossing work “over the wall” to operations, or passing a feature through multiple review layers.

How to reduce it:

- Build cross-functional teams (DevOps, full-stack squads).
- Automate CI/CD pipelines to reduce manual steps.
- Create shared visibility across the development lifecycle.

## 2. Inventory

In manufacturing, inventory means stock that isn’t adding value yet.
In software, it’s unfinished work: code sitting in branches, half-done features, unvalidated ideas.

Too much WIP clogs your flow and delays feedback.

How to reduce it:

- Limit WIP in sprints or Kanban boards.
- Merge small, frequent PR's instead of massive ones.
- Validate product ideas early (MVP's, feature toggles).

## 3. Motion

Motion waste in manufacturing is unnecessary physical movement.
In software, it’s the extra effort developers spend on non-value tasks - hunting down logs, waiting for environments, or manually configuring builds.

How to reduce it:

- Automate repetitive setup steps.
- Standardise environments with containers or scripts.
- Invest in internal developer experience (DX) tooling.

## 4. Waiting

Idle machines are costly; so are idle developers.
Waiting waste in software shows up as long build times, delayed reviews, or slow feedback from stakeholders.

Every minute waiting is a minute not learning, not improving, and not delivering.

How to reduce it:

- Automate builds, tests, and deployments.
- Encourage faster feedback loops (continuous integration).
- Keep reviewers accountable with lightweight, async reviews.

## 5. Overproduction

Overproduction is producing goods before they’re needed.
In software, it’s building features no one uses or developing too far ahead of validated demand.

This is one of the most expensive forms of waste - and the easiest to justify (“someone might need it someday!”).

How to reduce it:

- Focus on customer value, not feature volume.
- Validate hypotheses with real users before building.
- Deliver incrementally and measure adoption.

## 6. Overprocessing

Overprocessing happens when we do more work than necessary to achieve the same result.
In software, it’s the trap of overengineering - complex abstractions, unnecessary layers, and excessive documentation or process.

How to reduce it:

- Apply the YAGNI principle: You Aren’t Gonna Need It.
- Keep architectures simple until scale truly demands otherwise.
- Tailor processes to project complexity (no heavyweight workflows for small teams).

## 7. Defects

Just as defects on the factory floor require rework, bugs and regressions in software consume huge amounts of time and morale.

How to reduce it:

- Invest in automated testing and CI quality gates.
- Encourage pair programming or peer review for high-risk areas.
- Fix the root cause - not just the symptom.

## Bonus: 8. Unused Talent

Many lean practitioners add an eighth waste: not using people’s creativity.

In software, this is arguably the biggest one. When engineers are treated as ticket-takers instead of problem-solvers, innovation dies.

How to reduce it:

- Empower teams with ownership and autonomy.
- Encourage ideas from everyone - not just leads.
- Create space for experimentation (spikes, hack days, retros).

## Lean Thinking for Modern Software Teams

The seven wastes are more than a process checklist - they’re a mindset.
They challenge us to constantly ask:

> “Is this adding value for the customer, or just keeping us busy?”

By spotting and eliminating these wastes in your workflows, you’ll deliver faster, build smarter, and free up your team’s creative energy to focus on what truly matters: solving real problems.

Key Takeaway:

> Lean isn’t about doing more with less. It’s about doing only what matters.
