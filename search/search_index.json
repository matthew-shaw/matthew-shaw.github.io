The most efficient way to achieve that is through lower intensity and longer duration cardio exercise. I used to do a lot of running, but my heart rate would nearly always be in the anaerobic zone, so whilst I would burn more calories overall at a higher intensity, the source of that energy would be from a greater percentage of glycogen, and less from stored fats. I need to be aware of my heart rate while exercising, and to choose activities where I can moderate and pace myself accordingly.</p> <p>Much like ideal weight, there's a lot of different research and studies into maximum heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>) and heart rate zones. It's fair to say there's not a definitive answer, and it very much depends on the individual, so I'm going to go with collective wisdom again:</p> Name Formula HR<sub>max</sub> (bpm) Haskell &amp; Fox 220 \u2212 Age 181 Inbar 205.8 \u2212 (0.685 \u00d7 Age) 179 Nes 211 \u2212 (0.64 \u00d7 Age) 186 Oakland nonlinear 192 \u2212 (0.007 \u00d7 Age<sup>2</sup>) 181 Tanaka, Monahan &amp; Seals 208 \u2212 (0.7 \u00d7 Age) 181 Wingate 208.609 \u2212 (0.716 \u00d7 Age) 181 <p>Taking a rounded average gives me a HR<sub>max</sub> of 181 bpm. But what heart rate should I target in order to maximise the percentage of stored fat used as my primary fuel source? Unsurprisingly again, it depends!</p> <p>The definition of heart rate zones varies quite significantly too, with Polar, Garmin, Fitbit and Strava all using different percentage ranges to delineate them. Their names vary too, such as \"Zone 2\", \"Easy\", \"Light\" and \"Moderate\". In any case, it's all about the target heart rate (THR) percentage of my HR<sub>max</sub> and fortunately there's some general consensus that 60% to 80% is a good range, with the sweet spot at around 70%.</p> <p>70% of 181 is 127 bpm, so job done? No, not quite. A straight percentage doesn't take into account heart rate reserve (HR<sub>reserve</sub>), which is my HR<sub>max</sub> minus my resting heart rate (HR<sub>rest</sub>). This will change over time, as I get fitter my HR<sub>rest</sub> will decrease, giving me a higher HR<sub>reserve</sub>. The Karvonen formula takes this into account: THR = (HR<sub>reserve</sub> \u00d7 % intensity) + HR<sub>rest</sub>.</p> <p>Given my current HR<sub>rest</sub> of 61 bpm:</p> Formula 60% 65% 70% 75% 80% Percentage 109 118 127 136 145 Karvonen 133 139 145 151 157 <p>I need to exercise for at least 150 minutes per week at a target heart rate of around 145 bpm.</p>","tags":["Fitness","Weight Loss"]},{"location":"blog/2024/08/29/my-health-and-fitness-journey-part-1/#diet","title":"Diet","text":"<p>Weight loss happens in the kitchen, you can't out-train a bad diet. By far the biggest contributor to my progress will be consistently maintaining a calorie deficit, i.e. burning more calories than I consume. Of course, I'm not going to just starve myself, so a mixed and healthy diet is important, not just the latest trend of either cutting out or promoting one food group over another. Plenty of lean protein to keep the hunger at bay (and increase the Thermal Effect of Food, using more energy to digest it), low sugar, low fat, lots of water, and as little highly processed food as possible.</p> <p>I'm still going to eat meals with my family, which will include the occasional takeaway, as I know that denying myself everything that I enjoy will only lead to resenting the process and failing to achieve my goals. But unhealthy snacks, sugary drinks and alcohol will be kept to an absolute minimum.</p> <p>To work out how many calories I should consume, first I need to understand my Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR); the number of calories my body needs per day just being alive. This is based on gender, age, height, weight and lean mass, and again there are different formulas for calculating this. Based on my starting weight of 94.4 kg:</p> Name Formula BMR (kcal/day) Cunningham 500 + (22 x Lean mass) 1780 Harris-Benedict (Original) 66.47 + (13.75 x Weight) + (5.003 x Height) - (6.755 x Age) 1962 Harris-Benedict (Revised) 88.362 + (13.397 x Weight) + (4.799 x Height) - (5.677 x Age) 1957 Katch-McArdle 370 + (21.6 x Lean mass) 1627 Mifflin-St Jeor (10 x Weight) + (6.25 x Height) - (5 x Age) + 5 1829 Owen 879 + (10.2 x Weight) 1842 Schofield 11.6 x Weight + 879 1974 <p>Taking an average gives me a BMR of 1853 kcal per day. From there I can work out my Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) which uses a multiplier to take into account my activity level:</p> Activity level Multiplier TDEE (kcal/day) Sedentary 1.2 2224 Light exercise (1-2 days a week) 1.375 2548 Moderate exercise (3-5 days a week) 1.55 2872 Heavy exercise (6-7 days a week) 1.725 3196 Athlete (2x a day) 1.9 3521 <p>I want to do my 150 minutes of exercise per week over 3 days, so the \"moderate exercise\" multiplier gives me a TDEE of 2872 kcal per day. But, that's to maintain my current (starting) weight. A healthy weight loss of between 0.4 kg and 0.9 kg per week requires a calorie deficit of between 500 kcal to 750 kcal per day. So, I need to limit my intake to between 1872 to 2122 calories per day, in addition to exercise, to create a consistent deficit. As my weight reduces, the number of calories needed will reduce too, so I will need to evaluate this regularly.</p> <p>But 1800 calories of chips every day isn't going to help me, so where should those calories come from? Thats where macronutrients come in; the percentage of carbohydrates, protein and fat in my overall diet. To help preserve lean mass, support recovery and satiety I need to prioritise lean protein, with about 35% of my calories coming from this source. I also need to keep fat consumption low, but not cut out altogether to support hormones and joint health, for about 25% of my calorie intake. The remaining 40% is made up of carbohydrates, giving me fuel for exercise but without overloading calories.</p> <p>To work out how much of each nutrient I need, multiply my target calorie intake by the target nutrient percentage, then divide that by the number of calories per gram:</p> Nutrient Ratio Calories Calories per Gram Grams Protein 35% 655 4 kcal/g 164 Fat 25% 468 9 kcal/g 52 Carbohydrate 40% 749 4 kcal/g 187","tags":["Fitness","Weight Loss"]},{"location":"blog/2024/08/29/my-health-and-fitness-journey-part-1/#how-long-will-it-take","title":"How long will it take?","text":"<p>I want to reach and maintain my weight in my target range by my 40th birthday, which gives me just under a year to achieve it.

A commonly accepted figure is that 1 kg of body fat stores approximately 7,700 kcal of energy. My body composition data shows my fat mass dropped from 36.2 kg to 14.1 kg, a total fat loss of 22.1 kg.</p> <p>Now for the maths: 22.1 kg of fat \u00d7 7,700 kcal/kg = 170,170 kcal</p> <p>That is the total calorie deficit I achieved over the entire year, purely from fat stores. To find the average daily deficit, we divide by the 364 days in the 52-week period: 170,170 kcal \u00f7 364 days = 467 kcal/day</p> <p>This is the most satisfying finding of the entire experiment. My theoretical plan aimed for a deficit starting at 500 kcal, and my real-world, observed average deficit calculated from the fat I actually lost was 467 kcal.</p> <p>Conclusion: The TDEE and BMR formulas I researched in Part 1 were not just academic; they were incredibly accurate predictors of my real-world energy needs. It confirms the core principle: a small, consistent, and mathematically-sound calorie deficit will deliver predictable results. Every calorie I logged, every workout I tracked, was a data point reinforcing the fundamental law of thermodynamics: energy in versus energy out.</p> <p>By prioritising lean protein (35% of calories), moderating fats, and keeping carbohydrates functional rather than indulgent, I avoided the \"diet fatigue\" that derails most plans.</p>","tags":["Fitness","Weight Loss"]},{"location":"blog/2025/11/02/my-health-and-fitness-journey-part-3/#exercise","title":"Exercise","text":"<p>The Plan: To perform 150+ minutes of cardio per week at a Target Heart Rate (THR) of ~145 bpm, calculated using the Karvonen formula.</p> <p>The Theory: This \"Zone 2\" or \"Moderate\" intensity exercise would maximise the percentage of calories burned from stored fat (rather than glycogen) and, when combined with a high-protein diet, help preserve lean muscle mass.</p> <p>The Analysis: This is where the body composition data becomes crucial.

Of all the weight I lost:</p> <ul> <li>89.5% was Fat</li> <li>10.5% was Lean Mass</li> </ul> <p>Conclusion: This is a phenomenal success. It is metabolically impossible to be in a significant calorie deficit for a year and lose zero lean mass. However, my lean mass remained remarkably stable, while my fat mass plummeted. To have kept ~90% of the loss to fat is a direct validation of the plan. The lower-intensity cardio strategy delivered exactly what the literature suggests: improved fat oxidation, better recovery, and reduced cardiovascular strain.

Reflecting on the process, a few things stand out, many of which echo the principles in Atomic Habits, which was an inspirational resource for me.</p> <ol> <li>Trust the Process (Plateau of Latent Potential): There were plateaus and rebounds. In weeks 45-48, my weight stalled completely at 71.6 kg. In the past, this would have caused me to panic, over-train, or crash diet. This time, I trusted the data. I was in what James Clear calls the \"Plateau of Latent Potential\" \u2014the work was being done, but the results were delayed. I knew my deficit was in place, and sure enough, the trend resumed. You must trust the system, not the noisy data of a single day.</li> <li>Consistency Beats Intensity (Systems &gt; Goals): This entire journey was not about \"beasting\" myself in the gym, or starving myself. It was about the relentless, boring, and sustainable effect of consistency. A 500 kcal deficit is barely noticeable. A 30-minute run at 145 bpm is challenging but not destructive. Each time I did it, I was \"casting a vote\" for the new identity I wanted to build. My goal might have been to reach a healthy weight, but the system was what got me there: daily calorie tracking, structured exercise, and weekly reviews. I didn't wake up every day trying to \"lose weight\"; I just followed my system. The outcome became inevitable.</li> <li>The 5% Goals Were Critical (Make it Satisfying): A 25 kg weight loss goal is demoralising. A 5% goal (4.7 kg) is achievable. The plan in Part 1 to set these incremental goals was a lifeline. The \"Goals\" table in Part 2 shows I ticked one off every 2-3 months. This turned long-term delayed gratification into short-term reward. It was the perfect way to \"Make it Satisfying\" and keep the \"dopamine reward train\" on the tracks.</li> </ol> <p>Atomic Habits</p> <p>\"You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.\"</p> <p>I've learned that self-discipline isn't about pure willpower \u2014 it's about environment design.

This final part is about the force that gives rise to both. The Japanese term Muri (\u7121\u7406) roughly translates to \"overburden\" or \"unreasonable load\". In the original Toyota Production System, Muri was physical: asking a worker to lift a box that was too heavy. In modern software delivery, it is the invisible pressure we put on the two load-bearing parts of any technology organisation: the people who change the system and the system they are forced to change.</p> <p>It's not dramatic, it's not loud and it doesn't announce itself with outages. Muri accumulates slowly and becomes the norm. And because of that, it's the most dangerous of the three.</p> <p>There's a well-known paper called Boiling Frogs by GCHQ that describes how organisations degrade not through a single catastrophic mistake, but through a gradual series of tiny concessions. A workaround here, an exception there, a deadline accepted \"just this once\". The water warms degree by degree and no one jumps out. They acclimatise, they adapt and they cope.</p> <p>Then one day, the system is brittle, the team is exhausted, and delivery feels like wading through treacle, but no one can quite explain how it happened.

But software architecture and team structure are two expressions of the same underlying system. Therefore, meaningful architectural improvement doesn't begin in diagrams. It begins with team design. This isn't just theory; it's an actionable strategy.</p> <p>It would be too costly and time consuming to enact this approach for an entire organisation in one big hit. So, although these steps read linearly, in practice they're iterative, overlapping, and most effective when applied to one domain at a time. Pick a single Bounded Context to start with. Don't pick the simplest one, or the smallest one, pick something in the middle, with enough gnarly parts to overcome that will prove the approach is resilient, repeatable and credible.</p> <ol> <li>Map Your Business: First, stop guessing. Use the analytical tools from Domain-Driven Design, like Event Storming or Context Mapping, to create a true map of your business value streams. This isn't a technical diagram for engineers; it's a strategic map of what your business actually does and where the natural seams lie. This process reveals your true Bounded Contexts.</li> <li>Define Your Target Architecture: Once you have your map, you can make the strategic-level decisions. You intentionally design the target architecture that aligns with those Bounded Contexts. This blueprint, where services and products have clear, single owners, becomes the model for your new organisation.</li> <li>Execute the Manoeuvre: Now, execute the Reverse Conway Manoeuvre. This is the leadership act of re-organising your people to match the target blueprint. Use the Team Topologies patterns as your guide. Your Bounded Contexts become the mission for new Stream-aligned teams. Common, repetitive work that burdens them is extracted and given to Platform teams. This isn't just moving boxes on an org chart; it's empowering teams with a clear mission and sustainable cognitive load.</li> <li>Defend the New Boundaries: A new org chart is useless if you don't defend it. You must rigorously define and protect the interaction modes for your new teams. It can be useful to define a \"Team API\", not a software interface, but a clear agreement on how the team works, communicates, and accepts requests. This is how you make the change stick. It prevents the old, high-friction patterns of communication and dependency from creeping back in, ensuring your new, low-stress, high-flow state is sustainable.</li> </ol> <p>This plan is a fundamental, sociotechnical operation.

This is the pervasive anxiety generated by a culture of low psychological safety. It is just as important as balancing cognitive load, if not more so, because people that don't feel safe will not engage with profound organisational change, and change requires trust.</p> <p>That plan requires individuals to do things that would make them feel vulnerable in a low-trust environment:</p> <ul> <li>Be honest about how things really work.</li> <li>Challenge existing boundaries, power structures, and \"the way we've always done things\".</li> <li>Admit ignorance and ask \"stupid\" questions.</li> <li>Debate and disagree (respectfully) with colleagues and managers.</li> </ul> <p>The Accelerate and DORA research provides strong evidence for this. A culture of fear and blame, where people are punished for failures, unreasonable deadlines are normalised, or raising concerns is seen as \"negative\", is a significant predictor of low performance.</p> <p>This culture is a factory for anxiety.

This is managed by a scheduled task that runs every night at midnight (UTC) to delete all time entries started over 12 weeks ago. The account page has been updated to show the length, date and amount of history retained to keep users informed.

At school I enjoyed racquet sports like tennis, badminton and squash, but that was offset by a hatred of being forced to play football and rugby. I particularly hated doing cross country running on, seemingly, only the very worst days of the British winter. The only kind of regular exercise I've done for the last 5 years or so is drumming in rock bands, which is surprisingly more aerobic than you might think, but still not exactly intensive.</p> <p>In February 2018 I set myself a reasonable initial target; lose 1 stone (~6.4 kg) with no particular time frame in mind, just at a sustainable rate. I had no immediate desires to get fitter, stronger or healthier, I just wanted to weigh less and feel better about my body image. My starting weight was 87 kg, the most I think I've ever weighed. The previous month I had finally given in and bought bigger jeans, or \"fat pants\" as I called them, that actually fit me properly. Something had to change.</p> <p>I started walking more; by walking to work during the week and each weekend doing a longer 5 km or 6 km walk. The more I did it the more I thought; \"I really could run some of this route if I tried\". So I bought myself some new running trainers and sought the advice of my friends and colleagues who are into \"that fitness stuff\", as I jokingly referred to it.</p> <p>That's how I discovered the Couch to 5K running plan. I wont go through the details of how the plan is structured, but suffice to say it even managed to get a disillusioned and reluctant runner like myself to actually love running. That very first run was a real eye opener; eight intervals of one minute runs that showed just how unfit I was. It was tough, but rather than be put off, I used it as a baseline to improve upon. Some runs were harder than others (not only when the intervals got longer), but slowly and surely my stamina improved, my heart rate went down and my recovery time got shorter.</p> <p>I stuck with it, through wind, rain, snow and injuries. A particular low point was tripping over and ending up in A&amp;E for 6 hours with a black eye and suspected fractured hand. But even when I really didn't feel like going out running after a hard day at work I knew I would always feel much better afterwards and that kept me doing it.</p> <p>During the Couch to 5K plan I:</p> <ul> <li>Covered a total distance of 110.3 km \u2014 That's roughly the same as London to Dover.</li> <li>Spent a total of 13 hours exercising\u200a\u2014\u200aThat's the same time as flying from London to Singapore.</li> <li>Climbed a total of 1,511 m \u2014 That's 12.4% higher than Ben Nevis.</li> <li>Burned a total of 11,310 calories \u2014 That's 22.3 McDonalds Big Mac burgers.</li> </ul> <p>The benefits to my physical health have been huge. As of the time of publishing this:</p> <ul> <li>I've lost a total of 15 kg (~2 st 5 lb) since February 2018. 4.6 kg(~10.1 lb) of that was during the Couch to 5K plan.</li> <li>My BMI was 30.1 (Obese) and is now 24.9 (Healthy).</li> <li>I've reduced my body fat by 11%.</li> <li>My resting heart rate was around 65 bpm before I started regular aerobic and cardio exercise, now it's around 48 bpm.</li> <li>My VO2 Max estimate was 40\u201344, now it's 51\u201355, going from \"average\" for men my age, to \"very good\" by Fitbit's calculations.</li> <li>My \"fat pants\" now only stay on thanks to a belt, otherwise they will literally drop off me. I'm not sure exactly how many inches I've lost from my waistline since I never measured it, but I'd guess about 4. I'm also wearing shirts from years ago that I liked too much to throw away.</li> </ul> <p>If you're reading this and considering starting running, I honestly cannot recommend Couch to 5K highly enough, and I never thought I'd be saying that.

In much the same way as video games can help people with anxiety through inbuilt reward systems, apps like Fitbit and Strava were providing the continual gradual improvement and rewards I needed to keep me motivated.</p> <p>Running changed from something I was doing to get fit to something I was doing for my own headspace, purely for me, and I didn't feel guilty about doing it. Getting fitter changed from \"I'm so fat, my jeans don't fit anymore\" to feeling confident enough to take a compliment about my appearance without questioning their motives. Losing weight was less about the number and more about setting a target, sticking to it and achieving it.</p> <p>Research shows that regular aerobic exercise is as effective as antidepressants. I'd had some pretty unpleasant side effects from the latest type of antidepressant I was taking, but I was feeling the benefits of the counselling and increased exercise, so I decided to stop taking them.

It isn't a proposal for a reorg or a push toward yet another delivery methodology. Instead, it offers a systemic way to uncover and fix the real causes of delays, rising costs, unplanned work, and unpredictable outcomes. These problems rarely come from individuals or tooling; they show up when waste, uneven flow, and overburden accumulate across teams, governance processes, and legacy architectural boundaries.</p> <p>Decades of research shows that high-performing organisations get three parts of the system working together: team design, technical architecture, and product flow. When any of these drifts out of sync, the whole system becomes fragile. Operational load creeps up, lead times become erratic, and delivery costs rise. This white paper outlines a sociotechnical way to bring these parts back into alignment (step by step, with low risk) so teams can move faster and more predictably without disrupting existing commitments.</p> <p>Taking this approach leads to real, observable benefits: faster and steadier delivery, lower cost of delay, fewer operational surprises, a better handle on risk, and a higher return on the time and money already being spent. It also reduces burnout and churn by tackling chronic overburden and clarifying who is responsible for what. These improvements don't depend on adding headcount or buying new tools; they come from simplifying boundaries, reducing handoffs, limiting work-in-progress, and making flow more visible.</p> <p>The cost of doing nothing is equally clear. When systemic waste and uneven flow are left alone, technical debt piles up, systems get more fragile, governance gaps widen, adaptability slows, and the total cost of ownership climbs. This white paper shows how to avoid that trap with a structured, incremental approach that starts by identifying where flow is breaking down, choosing a sensible pilot domain, and iterating using evidence instead of wishful thinking. By focusing on how the system fits together rather than optimising isolated parts, organisations can improve performance while becoming more adaptable and resilient.</p>","tags":["Agile","Cognitive Load","Continuous Delivery","DevOps","Domain-Driven Design","DORA","Extreme Programming","Kanban","Lean","Platform Engineering","Team Topologies","Technical Debt"]},{"location":"blog/2025/12/12/lean-thinking-in-modern-software-delivery/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>In manufacturing, Lean thinking revolutionised how products were built by relentlessly eliminating waste.

Your Bounded Contexts become the mission for new Stream-aligned teams. Common, repetitive work that burdens them is extracted and given to Platform teams. This isn't just moving boxes on an org chart; it's empowering teams with a clear mission, their own budget, and the authority to make decisions, resulting in sustainable cognitive load.</li> <li>Defend the New Boundaries: A new org chart is useless if you don't defend it. You must rigorously define and protect the interaction modes for your new teams. It is essential to define a \"Team API\" for each team; a description and specification that improves the team's clarity of purpose and helps other groups understand how that team fits into the broader organisation. This is how you make the change stick. It prevents the old, high-friction patterns of communication and dependency from creeping back in, ensuring your new, low-stress, high-flow state is sustainable.</li> </ol> <p>This plan is a fundamental, sociotechnical operation.

Likewise <code>:application</code> corresponds to the name of a file inside the <code>data</code> directory which contains the structured JSON data that is passed to the <code>draft.html</code> template.
