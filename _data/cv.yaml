Digital transformation is difficult, and we faced challenges at almost every step - cultural challenges, legal challenges, design challenges, not to mention the technical ones. Matt met these head on with an open and critical mind. Matt is the type of expert who is willing to engage and learn new things all the time. His desire to build the right things in the right way comes through day to day. I hope we get to work together again!</em>

  - description: <em>I worked with Matt for about a year at Land Registry, where he was a Technical Architect for the team I was on. I was continually impressed by his knowledge, insight, focus and good humour, and I really enjoyed working with him. I learnt a lot from Matt, particularly about system architecture and microservices, which isn't my core domain - but also about Python programming, which is. He's pretty handy in an escape room too!</em>
